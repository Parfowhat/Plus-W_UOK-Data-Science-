# Love Compatibility Calculator

This Python program calculates the love compatibility between two people based on the occurrence of letters in the words "TRUE" and "LOVE."

## Usage

1. Run the program and input the names of the two individuals when prompted.

   ```python
   Enter first person name: [Name1]
   Enter second person name: [Name2]
   ```

2. The program will then calculate the love score and display the result.

   ```python
   The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
   Your score is [LoveScore].
   ```

3. Interpret the result based on the following criteria:
   - Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90: "Your score is [LoveScore], you go together like coke and mentos."
   - Love Scores between 40 and 50: "Your score is [LoveScore], you are alright together."
   - Other Love Scores: "Your score is [LoveScore]."

## Example

```python
# Input
name1 = "Kanye West"
name2 = "Kim Kardashian"

# Output
The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
Your score is 42, you are alright together.
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How It Works

The program counts the occurrences of the letters in the words "TRUE" and "LOVE" in the input names and calculates a love score. The score is then interpreted according to predefined criteria.
