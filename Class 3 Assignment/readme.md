# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This simple Python console game allows users to play the classic Hangman word-guessing game.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the game.

```bash
python hangman.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the letters and try to discover the hidden word.

## How It Works

- The game starts by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list.
- An initial display is created with underscores for each letter in the chosen word.
- Players are prompted to guess a letter, and the game checks if the letter is in the chosen word.
- Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the display, and the hangman visual representation is updated.
- Incorrect guesses result in a deduction of lives, and the game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Tracks the player's progress with a visual representation of the hangman.
- Provides feedback on guessed letters and remaining lives.
- Ends the game when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
