# Virtual Coin Toss Program

This is a simple Python program that simulates a virtual coin toss. It randomly outputs either "Heads" or "Tails" based on a generated random number (0 or 1).

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `coin_toss.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `coin_toss.py` file is located.
5. Run the program by typing: `python coin_toss.py` and press Enter.

## Example Output

The program will display either "Heads" or "Tails" based on the random number generated.

Example:
Heads

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How It Works

The program uses the `random` module in Python to generate a random number (0 or 1). It then employs an if-else statement to determine and print the result.
